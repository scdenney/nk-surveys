**Title:** Inference under Constraint: Methodological Reflections on Surveying North Korean Migrants  
**Presenter:** Steven Denney

The presentation addresses the conditional validity of survey data collected from North Korean migrants, especially in South Korea, and outlines appropriate vs. inappropriate inferential use. The talk is based on comparative political science and methodological best practices in the study of migrant populations and authoritarian regimes.
